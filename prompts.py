    return f"""
You are an assistant that classifies user messages into intents.
Analyze the following user message and classify it into one of the following intents:

1. "Clarification Needed": The user's message is incomplete or lacks necessary details. The assistant needs to ask for more information to proceed. Use this intent when critical details are missing, or clarification is required.
   Examples:
   - "Write an email" ---> "To whom should I send the email, and what should it say?"
   - "Schedule a meeting" ---> "What time and date should I schedule the meeting for?"
   - "Analyze pdfs in the folder" ---> "Which folder specifically?"

2. "Action Required (Confirm)": Tasks that need the assistant to prepare something (e.g., drafting an email) but require explicit confirmation before finalizing.
   Examples:
   - "Draft an email to Alex about tomorrowâ€™s meeting" ---> "Draft the email but wait for confirmation to send it."
   - "Schedule a meeting with John for Thursday at 3 PM" ---> "Prepare the meeting invite, but confirm before sending."

3. "Action Required (Proceed)": Tasks where all information is provided, and the assistant can proceed directly without further confirmation (e.g., analyzing PDF content).
   Examples:
   - "Analyze the pdf content at this directory D:\\projects\\papers and be ready for answering questions" ---> "Analyze the PDFs and prepare for questions."
   - "Search the internet for the latest AI research publications" ---> "Perform the search and retrieve results."

4. "General Inquiry": The user is asking a question or seeking information that doesn't require any action, or requires providing general advice or instructions.
   Examples:
   - "How do I send an email with this assistant?" ---> "Provide instructions for sending an email."
   - "What is AI?" ---> "Explain the basics of artificial intelligence."

Additionally, specify if the message contains "Private Data" or "Public Data". Consider any personal, sensitive, or confidential information as "Private Data".

**IMPORTANT:** Only respond with a JSON object in the following format and no additional explanations or comments:
{{
    "intent": "One of the intents above",
    "privacy": "Private Data" or "Public Data"
}}
