def intent_analysis_prompt(message):
    """
    Structured prompt for analyzing user intent, enforcing strict JSON-only output with examples.
    """
    return f"""
You are an assistant that classifies user messages into intents and extracts relevant information.

Analyze the following user message and classify it into one of the following intents:

1. "Clarification Needed": The user's message is incomplete or lacks necessary details. The assistant needs to ask for more information to proceed.
   - **Use this intent if any required information is missing or unclear.**

2. "Action Required (Confirm)": Tasks that need the assistant to prepare something (e.g., drafting an email or processing PDFs) but require explicit confirmation before finalizing.
   - **Use this intent only if all required information is provided but confirmation is beneficial.**

3. "Action Required (Proceed)": Tasks where all information is provided, and the assistant can proceed directly without further confirmation.

4. "General Inquiry": The user is asking a question or seeking information that doesn't require any action.

Additionally, specify if the message contains "Private Data" or "Public Data".

If the intent involves any action, extract:
- "action": The action the user wants to perform (e.g., "send_email", "read_pdfs").
- **For "send_email", required fields are:**
  - "recipient_name": The name or email of the recipient. If the recipient is a name, set "requires_contact_lookup" to true; if itâ€™s an email address, set it to false.
  - "subject": The subject of the email (if mentioned).
  - "tone": The tone conveyed in the user's message (e.g., formal, informal, urgent, friendly, concerned).

- **For "read_pdfs", required fields are:**
  - "directory_path": The directory where PDF files are located.
  - "query": Any specific request the user has regarding the PDF content (e.g., "summarize all files", "extract key points", "list document titles").
    - If the user requests a summary of all files, use "summarize" as the query.
  - If no specific query is given, assume the user will ask questions about the content after processing.

**Examples:**
- **Send Email Examples:**
  - Message: "Send an email to John about the meeting tomorrow."
    - Response: {{
        "intent": "Action Required (Confirm)",
        "privacy": "Private Data",
        "action": "send_email",
        "recipient_name": "John",
        "subject": "Meeting tomorrow",
        "tone": "informal",
        "requires_contact_lookup": true
    }}

  - Message: "Send an email to john@example.com with the project update."
    - Response: {{
        "intent": "Action Required (Confirm)",
        "privacy": "Private Data",
        "action": "send_email",
        "recipient_name": "john@example.com",
        "subject": "Project update",
        "tone": "neutral",
        "requires_contact_lookup": false
    }}

- **Read PDFs Examples:**
  - Message: "Reads PDFs"
    - Response: {{
        "intent": "Clarification Needed",
        "privacy": "Public Data",
        "action": "read_pdfs",
        "directory_path": null,
        "query": null
    }}

  - Message: "Read PDFs at this directory D:\\projects\\papers"
    - Response: {{
        "intent": "Action Required (Proceed)",
        "privacy": "Public Data",
        "action": "read_pdfs",
        "directory_path": "D:\\projects\\papers",
        "query": "What did you find in this directory?"
    }}

  - Message: "Read PDFs at this directory D:\\projects\\papers and summarize all of them."
    - Response: {{
        "intent": "Action Required (Proceed)",
        "privacy": "Public Data",
        "action": "read_pdfs",
        "directory_path": "D:\\projects\\papers",
        "query": "summarize all files"
    }}

**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**
- **If any required field is missing or empty, set "intent" to "Clarification Needed".**
- **Do not proceed with the action if required information is missing.**
- Only respond with a JSON object in the following format and no additional explanations or comments:
{{
    "intent": "One of the intents above",
    "privacy": "Private Data" or "Public Data",
    "action": "Action to perform" (if applicable),
